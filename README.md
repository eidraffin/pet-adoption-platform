## Pet Adoption Platform

This project is developed as a part of my CSE3 70: Database Systems course at Brac University.


## Overview

The motivation behind the website originates from the common dilemma faced by pet owners who find themselves unable to continue caring for their beloved companions. Rather than resorting to abandonment, many individuals seek to find loving homes for their pets through adoption. Recognizing this need, the platform aims to facilitate this process, providing a solution to the challenges encountered by both pet owners and prospective adopters.
